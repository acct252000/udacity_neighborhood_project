This web page provides a list of inline skate trails in the Dallas area with available weather information.  

### Installation, or How To Run

Download from the git repo here by clicking on the green Clone or download button on the upper right side and selecting Download Zip.
Unzip the files to your computer making sure to preserve the directory structure with the images, css and js folders as shown on GitHub.
Open index.html in web browser. You can do this by putting the path to the file in the address bar of the web browser (i.e. file:///Users/username/Documents/index.html).  You will need internet access for the map and the weather information to load.


### How to Use

This list can be filtered by minimum and maximum mileage by entering postive, numerical values in the fields indicated and clicking the "Miles Filter" button. The miles filter can be removed by clicking the "Remove Miles Filter" button.

This list can be filtered by text by typing in the text into the "Filter by Name" box.  The filter can be removed by removing the text from this box.

Clicking on a marker or list item will animate that skate's marker and show the info window.  The info window can be closed by clicking on the x in the info window box.

The info window displays the skate title, skate mileage, and current temperature, wind mph and direction, and relative humidity when weather information is available.  The wind mph displayed is not 100% reliable, use at your own risk.  This was left in as we all know how important wind speed is, if available, to skaters!

The navigation bar, if not displayed, can be shown by clicking the hamburger icon.  If displayed on a small screen and the hide arrow at the bottom is available, this can be clicked to hide the navigation bar.


### Known Issues

As mentioned above, at some points the wind speed does not appear accurate (0 or 99999).  This indicator was left in to use at your own risk.
